# CONTRIBUTING

### Introduction

First of all thank you for being here =)
Just remember, that all humans on a planet are Humans!

### How to make a thing?

1. Implement feature / fix the bug / etc.
2. Call your brach like `feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>` / `fix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`.
3. Write tests (optional now).
4. Run linter by command `uv run flake8 --select WPS melony/`
5. Make PR with description.
6. Enjoy! =)

### If i cannot make a feature?

Just remember, that you are able to create an issue (feature request or bug report), i really appriciate it. That small thing can change something.
Also you always have opportunity to write down to me a letter to wimble@internet.ru and i hope i will find some job for you on this project

# Good luck!
